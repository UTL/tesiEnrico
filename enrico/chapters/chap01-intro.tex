\section{Act-R}
Adaptive Control of Thoughtâ€”Rational

ACT-R is a cognitive architecture: a theory about how human cognition works. The aim of ACT-R is to model the behavior of the uman brain. This architecture is the ultimate successor of a series of increasingly precise models of human cognition, developed by John R. Anderson, who credits Allen Newell as source of influence to his theory.
From an external point of view ACT-R can be intended as a programming language; however its internal structure is based on assumptions about human cognition. The assumptions are established by psychologists, who research and study the human cognition, through numerous experiments. ~\cite{Allen94}

ACT-R's most important assumption is that human knowledge can be divided into two irreducible kinds of representations: declarative and procedural.


One important feature of ACT-R that distinguishes it from other theories in the field is 
that it allows researchers to collect quantitative measures that can be directly compared 
with the quantitative measures obtained from human participants.

Like a programming language, ACT-R is a framework: for different tasks 
(e.g., Tower of Hanoi, memory for text or for list of words, language comprehension, 
communication, aircraft controlling), researchers create "models" (i.e., programs) in ACT-R. 
These models reflect the modelers' assumptions about the task within the ACT-R view of 
cognition.
