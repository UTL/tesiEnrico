\subsection{OpenCV}
	OpenCV, \emph{Open Source Computer Vision}, is a library for computer vision. It was originally developed by Intel, and now it is supported by Willow Garage.
	It is a cross-platform library and it is released under a BSD license, thus it is free and open source. It was developed in C and C++ and then interfaces for Java and Python were added. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. The version 2.4 has more than 2500 algorithms. The library has been used in many applications as, for example, mine inspection and robotics.

	\subsubsection*{History}
	The OpenCV Project started in 1999 as an Intel Reasearch initiative aimed to improve CPU intensive applications as a part of projects including real-time ray tracing and 3D display walls. The early goals of the project were developing optimized code for basic vision infrastructure, spreading this infrastructure to developers, and making it portable and available for free without forcing the developers to create their applications for free.
	The first alpha version was released to the public in 2000, followed by five beta versions between 2001 and 2005, which lead to version 1.0 in 2006. In 2008, the technology incubator Willow Garage begun supporting the project and, in the same year, version 1.1  was released. 
	On October 2009, OpenCV 2.0 was released. It included many improvements, such as a better C++ interface, more programming patterns, new functions and multicore optimized implementations of old ones. Willow Garage releases official versions of OpenCV every six months.
